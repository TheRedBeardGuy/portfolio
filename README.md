# ⚔️ TheRedBeardGuy – Cybersecurity, Automation & Creative Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! I’m a cybersecurity student, freelance toolmaker, and digital problem-solver. This portfolio highlights my hands-on work in system automation, OSINT tooling, stealth AI assistants, and custom Linux hardware builds. Whether salvaging devices, scripting local LLM automation, or hardening privacy tools, I aim to create projects that are functional, fun, and field-tested.
