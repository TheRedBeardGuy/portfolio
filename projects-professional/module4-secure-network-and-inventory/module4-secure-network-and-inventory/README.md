# Module 4 – Secure Network Design & Home Device Inventory

This module focused on applying foundational security principles to both small business network design and home Wi-Fi device auditing.

## 🛡️ Part 1 – Secure Network Architecture (Hypothetical Company)

**Objective:**  
Design a secure small-business network from scratch, incorporating routers, switches, firewalls, and other layered defenses.

**Deliverables:**
- A full network diagram created using draw.io
- Written analysis of risks, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures
- Justification for chosen security controls (VPN, IDS/IPS, firewall rules, wireless segmentation, etc.)

**Security Features Implemented:**
- DMZ with public-facing services (web/mail)
- Separate internal VLANs for admin, sales, and guest access
- RADIUS for wireless auth, site-to-site VPN, and centralized firewall policies

📄 Also included implementation strategy, scaling ideas, and testing procedures.

## 📶 Part 2 – Home Network Device Inventory

**Objective:**  
Audit your home Wi-Fi network and document all connected devices.

**Collected for Each Device:**
- Device Type (e.g., PC, Roku, printer)
- MAC Address
- Local IP Address
- Usage Purpose (work, entertainment, smart home, etc.)

**Key Takeaway:**  
Discovered several IoT devices that were previously forgotten, like a smart plug and a backup printer — helped reinforce why regular home audits matter.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Security architecture isn’t just about placing firewalls — it’s about segmenting trust and anticipating threats
- Even home networks contain hidden attack surfaces
- Visualization helps tremendously when presenting security designs to non-technical users
