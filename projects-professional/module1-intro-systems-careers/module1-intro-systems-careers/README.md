# Module 1 ‚Äì Systems Overview & Career Pathway

This module covered two important cybersecurity foundations:

## üñ•Ô∏è 1. System Specifications (Tech Familiarity)

We explored how to gather and understand the hardware and OS-level specs of our current system. This included:
- Processor details (name, speed)
- RAM size and usage
- Hard drive capacity and free space
- Operating system info
- Memory load immediately after system login

The objective was to build awareness of what's running under the hood and how resource utilization impacts system performance ‚Äî critical for any future security analysis or system hardening task.

## üîç 2. Cybersecurity Career Reflection

We researched a real-world cybersecurity job posting (e.g., Security Analyst) and reflected on:
- Which skills we already possess
- What skills are still needed to meet the job requirements

This activity helped define a personal growth path within the industry and framed future modules through the lens of real job expectations.

## üß† Personal Takeaways

These two assignments gave me a clearer sense of:
- How to assess a machine like a sysadmin or SOC analyst
- What I need to focus on to grow into a cybersecurity role

More foundational than flashy, but it set the tone for everything after.
