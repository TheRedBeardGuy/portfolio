# Module 7 – Bash & Batch Scripting for System Automation

This module focused on writing automated scripts for both Linux (Bash) and Windows (Batch) environments. The goal was to create simple, functional tools that demonstrate file handling, system checks, and basic scripting logic.

## 🐧 Part 1 – Bash Shell Script: Linux System Organizer

**Objective:**  
Write a Bash script to automate file creation, disk/memory checks, and archive operations in a Linux terminal.

### Features:
- Creates a folder `ProjectAutomation` with subfolders: `Reports`, `Logs`, and `Scripts`
- Generates `ReadMe.txt` with timestamp and copies it to multiple directories
- Logs system info: uptime, memory, disk usage
- Creates symbolic links, updates file permissions
- Archives the project folder and displays archive size

📄 This script demonstrated real-world Bash automation techniques used in sysadmin and DevOps workflows.

## 🪟 Part 2 – Batch Script: Windows Setup Script

**Objective:**  
Create a `.bat` file to simulate an employee onboarding automation script using Windows Command Prompt.

### Tasks Performed:
- Creates `EmployeeSetup` folder with subfolders for Docs, Images, and Scripts
- Generates a `Welcome.txt` file and appends additional lines
- Moves and lists files, capturing output to `FileList.txt`
- Logs system date/time to `SystemInfo.txt`
- Uses `pause` and `echo` to show progress and completion

📄 This batch file is a great example of how to automate small internal IT tasks or user onboarding.
