## ⚔️ Research Project: Real-World Cyber Attack

**Objective:**  
Analyze a real-world cyber attack to understand how it happened, how it impacted the victim, and what was learned from it.

**Highlights:**
- Chose a recent newsworthy breach (e.g., ransomware, supply chain compromise)
- Described the technical method used by attackers
- Discussed vulnerabilities exploited and how it was mitigated
- Identified long-term lessons and potential prevention strategies

📄 This helped build awareness of how cyber attacks operate in the real world and how organizations react.

## 💻 Virtualization Lab Part 1 – Install Kali Linux in VirtualBox

**Objective:**  
Gain hands-on experience setting up a Linux-based ethical hacking environment.

**Key Steps:**
- Installed Kali Linux from ISO using VirtualBox
- Configured memory, disk size, and user accounts
- Took screenshots of the setup and working desktop environment

📄 This builds core skills for future pentesting and digital forensics labs.

## 🖥️ Virtualization Lab Part 2 – Install Windows 10 in VirtualBox

**Objective:**  
Set up a test environment for simulating real-world OS targets.

**Key Actions:**
- Downloaded Windows 10 ISO and installed it on a separate VM
- Allocated appropriate virtual hardware
- Took screenshots of setup, installation, and initial login

📄 Learning to work with multiple VMs is essential for controlled lab testing, vulnerability scans, and red team practice.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How virtual machines simulate isolated systems safely
- How attackers exploit technical and human weaknesses
- That even “simple” attacks often succeed due to gaps in planning or monitoring

This module bridged theory with practical tools I'll continue to use in more advanced modules.
